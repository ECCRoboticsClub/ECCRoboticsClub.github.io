A repository uses for storing assets and updating the main website for ECC Robotics Club

### Getting Started
ECC Members who are interested in helping us decorating and contributing to the club website are most welcomed and appreciated. If you don't know how to write HTML, this is the perfect environment to learn, practice and apply your knowledge. Perchance, while you discovering the world of HTML, you could find yourself becoming a Web Developer in the future :wink:

### Real-Time Group Collaboration
* https://repl.it/join/albfgxpw-periplaneta
* Click on this link to help work on the website
---
### Prerequisites
1) A text editor, preferably something better than the normal "Notepad"
2) Nothing else really :laughing:
3) For real-time group collaboration, use repl.it
---
### Recommendations
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - A very versatile and lightweight "better" version of the original notepad. It has built-in HTML support and even other languages. You can even code C++ for your class on it if you want to give your heart adrenaline rush :sunglasses:
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - While using GitHub itself is easy and effortless, why not spend some extra time to dive more into the core behind GitHub and learn yourself a great tool for storing and keeping track of your future projects
* [That One Guy On Youtube That Every People In Comp Sci Classes Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqszz_OfAFQ&list=PLC1322B5A0180C946) - Thenewboston is a great channel that can help you start strong with your HTML if you know nothing or feeling a little bit rusty on your HTML skill. He does a lot of tutorial for other Comp Sci classes too, definitely recommend :heart_eyes:
* [Git Game](https://github.com/git-game/git-game) - To learn more about how to use Git Bash

### Instructions
*The repository included template .html files that we chose to use for our website. If there's another website template that you want to use then please talk to us so we can discuss it.*

* First you want to download our repository through either a zip file (or git clone if you know how) using the green button **Clone or Download** up there on the top right corner.
* After you extract the zip files, you going to find around 8 files. The most important one that you'd probably be working on is the `index.html`
* Now the next steps are to replace all the place holder Latin texts exist in the HTML with your text that you think would represent the club.
##### Examples:
```css
<!-- Highlights -->
            <section class="wrapper">
                <div class="inner">
                    <header class="special">
                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>Nunc lacinia ante nunc ac lobortis. Interdum adipiscing gravida odio porttitor sem non mi 
                        integer non faucibus ornare mi ut ante amet placerat aliquet. Volutpat eu sed ante lacinia sapien 
                        lorem accumsan varius montes viverra nibh in adipiscing. Lorem ipsum dolor vestibulum ante ipsum 
                        primis in faucibus vestibulum. 
                        Blandit adipiscing eu felis iaculis volutpat ac adipiscing sed feugiat eu faucibus. Integer ac sed 
                        amet praesent. Nunc lacinia ante nunc ac gravida
                        <br>
                        “Nunc lacinia ante nunc ac lobortis ipsum. Interdum adipiscing gravida odio porttitor sem non mi 
                        integer non faucibus”
                        </br>
                        </p>
                    </header>
```
> These are cutout from lines 48-59 in *index.html*. As you can see, these strings are a bunch of nonsense. If you run the *index.html* using your default browser. You can see that these few lines of texts correspondes for this segment of the webpage:
<img src = "/images/readme_example.PNG" alt = "Example IMG">
> Now if you change just the text inside into something like this:

```css
<!-- Highlights -->
            <section class="wrapper">
                <div class="inner">
                    <header class="special">
                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>We are a group of enthusiasts in the STEM field who come together to share ideas, learn, 
                        and build robots.
                        We are devoted to having a hands-on environment for everyone to work in, and gain experience in 
                        other fields. Additionally, our members are ready to lend a helping hand, interact with the 
                        community, and most importantly have fun while demonstrating the importance of mathematics and 
                        science.  As students join us, we would like the opportunity to work with you on upcoming events 
                        and projects. Come in and  FLEX YOUR ROBOTICS MUSCLE!!!
                        <br>
                        “It does not matter your major robotics has a place for you!”
                        </br>
                        </p>
                    </header>
```
> Now it will turn in to this if you open the *index.html* again:
<img src = "/images/example2.PNG" alt = "Example IMG">

> Ain't that a :cake:

* When you feel like you're done with replacing all the texts. You can then push it back to your fork and make a pull request in the master repository. We will have multiples people looking at it, and if suffice, approve it to be on the club main webpage :thumpsup:
